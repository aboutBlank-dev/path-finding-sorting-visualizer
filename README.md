# [Pathfinding and Sorting Visualizer](https://aboutblank.dev/sorting-visualizer/quick)  

Website to visualize different Sorting and Pathfinding algorithms in a visually satisfying and intuitive way.
Made using React(vite). Actual visualization makes use of HTML Canvas.

## Sorting Visualizer
Sorting Algorithms available(possibly more in the future):
* Bubble
* Quick
* Insertion
* Gnome
* Merge
* Heap

## Pathfinding Visualizer
Pathfinding Algorithms available(possibly more in the future):
* Dijkstra
* A Star
* Breadth-first Search (BFS)
* Depth-first Search (DFS)

Maze Generation is also available(also visualizable); using the [recursive backtracking algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker)

You can also "paint" Wall/Empty squares, move the Start and End node and the graph updates responsively.
